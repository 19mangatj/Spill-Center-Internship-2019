# Spill-Center-Internship-2019
Includes three projects for my internship at Spill Center including a dynamic user form and report generators.

## Description of Projects

### claimRecordForm.vue
The claim record form was my first project working with the development team in the company. It was a way for me to familiarize myself with vue.js, a Javascript framework, and learn more about the dev team's main project at the time. This project included moving off of their current database onto a more user-friendly UI for their employees. 

### Claim.js
This project helped generate letters/reports that operations employees had to send to Spill Center's clients. Each client had their own set of letters and information they wanted to be sent. Although the letters were pregenerated, they included blank spaces to enter the specific information surrounding spills and cyber incidents that the cliets requested Before, employees had to manually enter in data. Through this project, however, I created functions using sql, JS, and Bootstrap that helped retrieve data from the company's database on Sequel Pro to help generate letters and reports automatically.

### prosrc.js (unfinished)
Due to time contraints, I was unable to finish my last project over the summer. However, this project was similar to the Claim.js project in that I had to generate a report that retrieved data from the Spill Center database for clients. This involved a lot more formatting through HTML and CSS, however, to make sure the information was being presented in a readable fashion.
